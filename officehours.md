### Staff and office hours   (Fall 2024)


We are lucky to have three LAs this semester! Danielle, Kaylie and
Patrick. They are all seniors and took the class as sophomores in
Spring 2023.


The weekly schedule will be posted soon.

Laura's office hours (Searles 219): Tuesdays 1-3pm (geometry students
