In this project you will implement geometric motion planning for a point robot
moving among polygonal obstacles in 2d  using the visibility
graph (VG) approach.

### Overview

One of the fundamental problems in robotics is motion planning: given
a robot moving in an environment (or: physical space), a start position
and an end position, find a path so that the robot can
move from start to end, without collisisons. Generally speaking, in
most situations we are happy to compute just a path, not necessarily
the optimal/shortest, but in some special situations we are able to compute
an optimal (shortest) path.

In this project we'll make some simplifying assumptions which will allow us to do optimal planning:

 - Physical space is 2D: The environment is 2D. 

 - Point robot: the robot is assume to be a point (not realistic, but a good place to start).
  
 - Obstacles: The obstacles consists of a set of 2D  polygons. Furthermore, we assume that
   the robot is moving in a large bounding box B that contains all
   polygons.

- Static: We'll assume that the environment is static (the obstacles
  are fixed and do not move).

- Known: The environment is known, i.e. the robot knows the list of
  obstacles with their vertices and edges. That is, the robot does not
  rely on sensors to learn the environment, instead the environment is
  given.


The general idea of motion planning is to construct a representation
of the free space (the space free of obstacles where 
robot can move).  The representation is refred to generically as a _roadmap_ and is
essentially a graph representing (movement through) the free space. Ideally we want to build a
graph/roadmap so that:

1. Any path in the roadmap corresponds to a collision-free path in the free space.
2. Any path in the free-space corresponds to a path in the roadmap.

Essentially this means that if a path exists in reality, the graph will have it, and if the graph has a path, it exists in reality.  Put differently, no false positive (graph finds a path, but path does not exist in reality), or false negatives (graph says no path exist, but path exists in reality). 

If we are able to compute a road map of free space with these
properties, then moving  from a location s to a location t is corresponds to finding a path in the road map
from s to t.  Essentially we have reduced the motion
planning problem to a path problem in a graph.

There are several types of roadpams that have been used, depending on
the specifics of the problem.  For a point robot moving among
polygonal obstacles in the plane, it is possible to construct a type
of roadmap that will allow to compute optimal paths: the visibility
graph.  This is a graph whose vertices are the vertices of the
obstacles, and its edges (u,v) are all the pair of vertices that can
"see" each other, that is, segment uv does not intersect the interior
of any obstacle. Some screenshots above and below.

Shortest paths in 2D have the very nice and convenient property that
they are straight lines, and they have to go through the vertices of
the obstacles (a path that takes you to a point interior to an edge and then continues to a vertex is not shortest). This basically means that any shortest path will be
contained in the VG. Once the visibility graph (VG) is computed, the
shortest paths from start to end can be computed for e.g. using
Dijkstra's algorithm.


### This project


1. When you start your code, have a simple pre-set scene with a couple of simple polygonal
obstacles.  Allow the user to reset the scene and and enter polygons
using the mouse (in a manner similar to previous projects).  


2. Once the scene is done, compute and render the visibility graph. Implement the straightforward algorithm that considers all possible pairs of vertices (u,v) and adds an edge to the visibility graph if segment uv does not intersect properly any edge of any obstacle.  Additionally, if u and v are on the same polygon,  you need to check whether segment uv  is inside the polygon that contains u and v, and if so, not include it in the visibility graph.

- Note that the edges of the polygons must be included in the visibility graph.
  
- Don't forget to add a vertex for the start/end positions, and edges to all visible vertices of the polygons. 


4. Allow the user to click on the start and end position of the
"robot" in the scene. Then, run Dijkstra's algorithm on the VG and
render the resulting path (for e.g. in a different color and different
line width). Let the user enter different start and end positions and re-compute the path. 


All the geometric primitives that you'll need for this project, you 
already have them.  So that part should work smoothly and quickly. The new part
is implementing Dijsktra's algorithm. In csci2200 we discussed the
pseudocode for Dijkstra. In this project you have an opportunity to
work through  the details.


### Dijkstra's algorithm 

__Adjacency list:__ When we work with graphs  we  assume that the graph is given  in an
adjacency list form, that is, every vertex has a list of all the vertices that it has edges to. In other words, a vector of vectors.   You want to think about this as you compute the VG. One way is to compute the VG directly into its adjacency list representation, and the other possibility is that when you compute the VG you create an array of edges, and after that you transform this into adjacency lists. 

Once you have an adjacency list for the VG,  you can use Dijkstra's algorithm straight out of a textbook. We describe it below. 

__Dijkstra's algorithm__ is a greedy algorithm to find the shortest paths from an arbitrary vertex (refered to as the _source_) to all other vertices in the graph. In our case we want the shortest path from _start_ to _end_, so we run Dijkstra from vertex _start_ until we reach vertex _end_, at which point we stop.  

Data structures needed: for each vertex _x_, we keep track of: 

- d[x] : this will eventually be the length of the shortest path from source to x
- p[x] : this is the predecessor of x on the shortest path from source to x
- done[x] : true if its shortest path has  been found

We'll also need a priority queue to store points and with their distance as priority: (x, d[x]). 

At each iteration,  we choose a vertex u which is not done and has minimum distance from source s. This node becomes __done__ and d[u] is the  length of the shortest path from s to u. All we have to do now is to update the distance to its neighbors which are not done.

## Extra features


* Implement a point-in-polygon method and use it to detect if start or
  end points are inside an obstacle.
* Detect if a polygon is self-intersecting.
* Detect if polygons are overlapping.
* Draw the polygons filled. Note that openGL can only fill correctly
  convex polygons, so if you want it filled, you'll need to compute a
  triangulation.




### Deliverables/What to turn in

You will receive the assignment on GitHub; it contains no code. Your github repository shoud contain:

* your code 

* The README file is the landing page for the repository and should
contain: (1) a one-sentence description of what the code is doing. and
(2) instrutions on how to run it. Totally fine to keep it minimal, but
anyone shoud be able to run your code after looking at your
README. It's also good practice to include there the bugs or
limitations of the project, so that anyone running is aware.

* A brief report showcasing your project, containing:
	* (1) images of your visibility graph and paths.  There isn't a required number of images, include what you consider a representative sample. 
	* (2) if your code does not work in all cases, explain.
	* (3) any extra features you implemented.
	* (4) Time you spent in: Thinking; Programming; Testing; Documenting; Total.
	* (5) Brief reflection prompts (you donâ€™t need to address all): how
challenging did you find this project? what are some things you learnt
by doing this project? Is there anything you wish you did differently?
If you worked with a partner, how did that go? Is there anything you would like  like to
explore further?

* Capture a movie of the screen while you demo your code and upload it
  to github as `demo.mov`. To demo, no voice, just run your code and
  show what it can do (To capture a movie on a Mac press
  `shift+command+5` and then choose the option that says `record
  selected portion`).
