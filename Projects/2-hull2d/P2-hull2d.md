## Project 2: Hull2d with Graham scan 

*** 
* __Assigned:__ Monday, September 23
* __Due:__ Wedneday,  October 3
* Group policy: Partner-optional 
* Collaboration policy: Level 1



In this assignment you will write code to find the convex hull of a
set of points in the plane using Graham's scan and come up with a
couple of testing cases.  

In addition, you will write a brief report to showcase your code,
containing (1) brief description of what sort of inputs constitute
degeneracies for the algorithm and how you handled these degeneracies;
(2) pictures of the two initializers you created (2) pictures of the
other initializers you used; (3) pictures of the convex hulls computed
for each initial configuration of points --- for all these choose a
reasonable value of n (4) if your code does not work in all cases,
explain.  (5) any extra features. (6) Time you spent in: Thinking;
Programming; Testing; Documenting; Total; (7) Brief reflection prompts
(you donâ€™t need to address all): how challenging did you find this
project? what did you learn by doing this project? What did you wish
you did differently? If you worked as a team, how did that go? What
would you like to explore further?)


### Overview

The goal is to figure out the details of the
algorithm discussed in class and specifically how to handle
degeneracies in the input.  You will receive starter code on
Github. The starter code provides the graphical interface and should
compile as is.

What you need to do:

* Fill in the graham_scan function, and anything else that may be
  necessary to make it all work.

* Come up with at least two sets of points on which to compute the
  hull, and write the corresponding initializer functions. The sets of
  points can be easy but should not be trivial. At least one of them
  should contain some collinear points.

* Post your special initialier functions to the whole class on Slack
  on the channel called #projects (to keeep things seasy to find,
  please post your initializer on #projects and not on #general).

* Include at least 5 of your classmates test cases in your code.



### What and how to turn in


You will receive the assignment on GitHub. Fill in the necessary
functions. You do not need to create any new files (but you can if you
want to).


- Update the Readme file with a brief description of the
project and how to run it.  If it is a team project, please include
the names.  Remember not to turn in any object or executable files.

- Check in your code to the github repository
- Also check in the pdf of the report
- Message me the pdf of the report
    


### Final remarks

Even though no part of the project is difficult, starting late will
certainly make it so. Plan accordingly.


Program well and enjoy!
