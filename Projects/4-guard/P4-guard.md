## Project 4:  Night at the Museum 


*** 
* __Assigned:__ Monday, October 14
* __Due:__  Wednesday 10/30 (suggested: part 1:  due 10/23, part 2 due 10/30) 
* Group policy: Partner-optional 
* Collaboration policy: Level 1

In this project you will write code to find the visible area of a
guard in a museum. The input will be a simple, non-intersecting
polygon in the plane which represents the boundary of the museum, and
a point inside this polygon which represents a guard. The goal is to
come up with and implement an algorithm that computes and displays the
part of the museum that's visible to the guard.  Note that the area
that's visible must be inside the museum (cannot see through the
walls), and must be a polygon (cannot have holes and islands).  We'll
refer to it as the _visible polygon_.

To manage complexity we'll split this project into two parts:

Part 1: Read the polygon and the guard from the user, compute the
visible polygon and display it.

Part 2: Extend so that the guard is moving inside the polygon and the
visible area is re-computed and displayed as the guard is moving. Move
the guard so that the guard does not get stuck in a corner of the
polygon.

### The interface

Unlike previous projects this one does not need to take any arguments
on the command line. To initialize a polygon and the position of a
guard inside the polygon you will use the mouse.

The user should press `s` to start the polygon, then click in the
window on the desired location of the vertices, then press `e` when
the polygon is done.  The user is expected to enter the polygon in
counter-clockwise boundary order. It's always helpful (and good style)
to print a message as the program starts to let the user know the
interface: So at the beginning your program should print ``` press 's' to start entering the vertices of the polygon
and 'e' to end.  Please enter the vertices counter-clockwise. ```

Once the user is done entering the polygon, your code should check
whether the polygon is simple (by implementing a function to do that);
if it is simple, it should print a message that the test is passed:
``` testing if polygon is simple:  passed ``` Otherwise, it should print a
message that the polygon is not simple and clear the polygon so that
the use can start again.  This suggest writing aa function to test
whether two segments intersect, which might look like this: 
```
\\return true if ab intersects with cd
bool seg_seg_intersect(point 2d a, b, c, d)
```
 
 
 
Once the user is done entering a simple polygon, the next step is to
click on the desired location of the guard.  In terms of interface, no
specific requirements.  You could assume that once the polygon is
finished, any mouse click represents a guard; or you can require that
the user presses `g` before clicking on the location of a guard,
otherwise the mouse clicks are ignored.  This is up to you, but make
sure to document it in the Readme file and also while the program is
running so that anyone is able to run your code (for e.g. you could
make your `keypress` function print the interface of your code when
key `h` is pressed).


The guard has to be inside the polygon. You can assume that the user
enters a guard that is inside.  You could write
a function to test whether a point is inside a polygon ---- this is a
nice algorithm to know about and we'll talk about it in
class. If do implement this , it is extra credit, and I  suggest you  do this at the
end once the other pieces are working. We'll discuss the basic idea in class, but the degenerate cases
are messy; there is full pseudocode in the O'Rourke textbook which I
suggest you check out and implement.

Once the polygon and the guard are set, you will (call your function to)
compute the visible polygon and (call the function to) render it.




### Computing the visible polygon

The crux of this project is to come up with an algorithm to compute
the visible polygon of the guard. We have not talked specifically
about this problem in class and the goal is to come up with a solution
on your own. In terms of running time, a quadratic algorithm will
suffice.

Towards an algorithm:  Draw a couple of polygons and try out some cases.  Start with simple polygons, such as convex.   How do you compute the visible polygon of a point inside a convex polygon? Now move to non-convex polygons: what is different? 

As we try out various cases we make a couple of observations: 

* Not all vertices of a non-convex polygon are necessarily visible. This suggests a helper function to determine if a vertex of a polygon is visible from the guard point `p`,  which might look something like this:   

```
\\return true if polygon[i] is visible from point p
bool isVisible(Vector<point2d> polygon, int i, point2d p) 
```

* The visible polygon consists of the vertices of the museum polygon that are visible, possibly interleaved with points interior to the edges of the museum that represent  intersections with rays from the guard.  The question is: how to compute these interior points? You will need to shoot rays through some vertices of the museum (which ones?), and, for each ray, find its first intersection with the boundary of the museum.   Some questions you will need to answer are:  through what vertices do you shoot the rays, and how do you get the points along the boundary of the visible polygon, in the right order?

### Rendering the visible polygon 

You will need to render the visible polygon filled. Note that visible polygon is not necessarily convex. 

You can tell OpenGL  to render polygons  boundary (`GL_LINE` mode) or filled (`GL_FILL` mode) with the following commands:

```
glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_LINE);
//glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_FILL);
```

Something to be aware of is that openGL can only render filled polygons that are __convex__. This seems like a big limitation, however if you think about it a little it becomes clear that it is not straightforward how to render a non-convex polygon filled: to do that essentially you need to compute the triangulation of the polygon, and then render one triangle at a time. Computing a triangulation of a non-convex polygon is a bigger problem which we'll talk about in the coming weeks, and OpenGL does not do it  as part of  the `glDraw` function.  

Even though it's not convex, the visible polygon has some nice properties that will make rendering it a lot easier!


__Rendering a transparent polygon:__  If you want to do alpha blending with OpenGL, you basically  need to  specify the color using 4 values, the usual RGB values plus a value that represents the transparency.   First, enable blending via glEnable(GL_BLEND) (ideally you would remember to disable it after again when not doing blending, since that will affect performance).  While drawing it, specify your method of blending as such: glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA). Make sure to give an alpha value to the colors youâ€™re specifying! 0 is transparent, and 1 is opaque. 

You could set up blending in your `display()` function: 

```
  glEnable(GL_BLEND);
  glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
```

Then when you want to  do  blending , specify your color with 4 values, like so: 

```
//set color 
  GLfloat color[4] = {1, 0, 0, 0.5}; //half-transparent red 
  glColor4fv(color);   
 ```




### Some  ideas for extra features  and extensions

* As mentioned above, implement checking whether the point is inside the polygon (the ray crossing algorithm). 

* Add more than one moving guards, and render their visible areas transparently, so that the overlap is easy to see, like so:   <a href="https://tildesites.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs3250-CompGeom/fall21/Assignments/A5-artGallery/dylanisaac-guarding-demo.mov">demo1</a> ;   <a href="https://tildesites.bowdoin.edu/~ltoma/teaching/cs3250-CompGeom/fall21/Assignments/A5-artGallery/wk-moving_guards.mov">demo2</a>

* If you are ready for a bigger challenge, you could try to come up with an improved algorithm
that runs in `O(n lg n)` using a radial sweep (hint: process the
vertices in radial order around the guard).  Several algorithm are
known for computing the visible polygon faster than the quadratic
algorithm: the algorithm by Joe and Simpson runs in `O(n)` time, and
the one by Asano in `O(n lg n)` time. A recent algorithm by Mungiu et
al seems to be the fastest in practice.  If you have time and will to
consider an improved algorithm, that's pretty awesome, but you shoud
definitely do it only after you get it to work the easier/quadratic way.  The
papers listed below may be helpful.

### What to turn in

You will receive the assignment on GitHub. In addition to the code, your repo has to contain the following 3 files: 

* The README file is the landing page for the repository and should
contain: (1) a one-sentence description of what the code is doing. and
(2) instrutions on how to run it. Imagine yourself looking at this
project 10 years from now, the README will come to the rescue. 

* A brief report showcasing your project, containing:
	* (1) images of your guard and visible polygon in various positions.  There isn't a required number of images, include what you consider a representative sample. 
	* (2) if your code does not work in all cases, explain.
	* (3) any extra features you implemented.
	* (4) Time you spent in: Thinking; Programming; Testing; Documenting; Total.
	* (5) Brief reflection prompts (you donâ€™t need to address all): how
challenging did you find this project? what are some things you learnt
by doing this project? Is there anything you wish you did differently?
If you worked with a partner, how did that go? Is there anything you would like  like to
explore further?

* Capture a movie of the screen while you demo your code and upload it
  to github as `demo.mov`. To demo, no voice, just run your code and
  show what it can do (To capture a movie on a Mac press
  `shift+command+5` and then choose the option that says `record
  selected portion`).

### Start early, program well and enjoy the proces!

This project is significantly harder than the previous ones and has
 a few  pieces that you'll have to put together (such as segment
intersection) and work to handle degenerate cases. It is crucial that you
develop your code one piece at a time, and test before you move on to
the next.  From the beginning, design your code knowing that you will
spend 95% of the time debugging it.  Code intentionally to make the
debugging easier.
